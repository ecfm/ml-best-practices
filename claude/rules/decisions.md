# Study-Specific Decisions

When the choice is obvious from context or data structure (e.g., grouped split for multi-row-per-unit data, standard normalization), make the choice and state it clearly.

When the choice is genuinely ambiguous or could invalidate results (e.g., evaluation metric, binarization threshold, outlier exclusion, comparison baselines), always ask the user before proceeding.

When deviating from standard practice, always ask.

See experiment-practices.md section 8 for details.
